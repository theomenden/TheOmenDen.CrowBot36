# CrowBot36

- This is The Omen Den's official Chatbot for Twitch
- While we recognize the amazing work of other cloud based bots such as Nightbot, and hosted bots such as Streamer.Bot - we wanted to role our own.
- This bot aims to provide direct integration with Spotify, Shopify, Patreon, Twitch, Discord, Minecraft (Fabric clients), Tiltify, and other various providers. 
- We also are aiming to provide a python interpreter, a java compiler, and a C# compiler
  - While ambitious, we know this will take a LOT of time.
- We're also going to provide a tight direction with Crows Against Humility - The Omen Den's featured Blazor Cards against Humanity Client (not affiliated).

- There will be an option of course to support the project which will unlock some neat API features, but nothing is behind the paywall that you can't add yourself by browsing the source code here and having the appropriate keys. We just want to provide an easier functionality for plug and play. 

- Keep track of our development!

- Written in Blazor, and powered by the Blazorise Component Library. 
- Using TwitchLib for twitch interactions
